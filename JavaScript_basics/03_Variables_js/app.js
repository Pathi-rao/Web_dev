// Variables - Most building block
// Varaibles - Store, Acess, Modify == Value
// Declare, Assginment Operator, Assign Value

let name = 'Pathi';    // Can assign  a new name later on
const new_name='Bandi' // Cannot assign a new name later on
var new_new_name = 'Ulli' // Used in olden days and later changed to let and const.

name = 'Dalli'
console.log(name);
console.log(new_name);

// JS is loosely type which means we dont need to declare the type of variable

// When the value in console log is blue its a number
// If black then it's a string.


//  CAREFUL OF IMPLICIT TYPE CONVERSION IN JS

// When you try to substract two strings, it gives you NaN
// But if you wrap the numbers into a string and do the opertion, it works in a console
